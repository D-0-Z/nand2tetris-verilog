a note on testing outputs:

test outputs look like the following, for example:

and                    0 0 0 (0 0)
and                    1 0 1 (0 0)
and                    2 1 0 (0 0)
and                    3 1 1 (1 1)

in these outputs, the intent is that for each set of parens, the numbers in the middle should be identical.
this should hopefully be convenient for scripting (and if it isn't, i apologise ;))
